## Certifying Technical Interviews


### Overview
Fellows will receive Certification in Technical Interviews by passing a Mock Interview with a “certification volunteer”. Certification Volunteers are a set group of volunteers with technical experience who have been trained to certify Fellows for technical interviewing. Fellows that are at the 85% readiness mark for both non-DSA and DSA, and 100% for whiteboarding are generally considered “ready” for the technical interview certification. Fellows must pass one technical interview (receive proficient or above in every rubric row) with a certification volunteer in order to receive the Certification.

### Scheduling interviews
Fellows will work with Program Managers to schedule interviews. Fellows will be scheduled if they’ve practiced whiteboarding with their Instructional team and have scored “proficient” across the rubric.  Interviews are available M-Th from 6 PM - 8PM.

### Recording Interviews 
We highly encourage Fellows to record their whiteboarding interview via Quicktime on their laptops so that they can watch their interview and share it with instructors for further feedback. Please keep videos and mock interview questions private for equitability across all Fellows. 

### Rescheduling Interviews
If the Fellow is unable to make the scheduled time, they can switch with another Fellow who’s already scheduled up to 48 hours in advance. If a Fellow is a no-show for the interview or reschedules last minute for any reason, they will not be rescheduled for at least two weeks.

### Recording lateness/no-shows
Fellows will check in with the Program Manager (or whoever is responsible that day for checking in Fellows to their interviews) to record attendance. If a Fellow is “Late”, “No Show with Communication”, or “No Show Without Communication", this is considered a potential red flag toward job readiness. 

### Sharing Feedback to Fellows
For all Fellows: Fellow will receive a summary of qualitative feedback from their Lead Instructor in writing via email (not slack). 
For those who "pass": A Fellow may also follow up with their Lead Instructor in person.
For "needs prctice in key areas": Lead instructor and Fellow will schedule a 20 minute debrief where the Lead Instructor shares a summary of feedback from the interviewer and discuss: 
* How did you think it went? 
* Where did you struggle? Where did you do well? 
* How will you keep practicing?

### Re-assessing Technical Interviews
After Fellows receive qualitative feedback from the interviewers, they should continue to practice whiteboarding by signing up for Office Hours with the instructional team, before letting their PM know they’d like to schedule another mock technical interview. In order for Fellows to set up a second mock interview, there must be a minimum of one whiteboarding office hours session with the Lead Instructor or an IA and at least one week of independent practice completed.


## Certifying Behavioral Interviews 

### Interview format
Fellows will have 45 minutes for their mock interview with a volunteer. Prepare for this as a real interview, including how you dress, and how you research the company and role. Fellows will be assessed along the updated [link] Behavioral Interview rubric.
 
### Scheduling interviews
Program Managers will sign up Fellows who are ready for mock behavioral interviews every two weeks. Contact the PM via email to confirm the date, time, location and relevant job description for interview. Fellows will be scheduled if they’ve practiced Behavioral Interviews with the PM already and have scored “proficient” across the rubric.  

### Rescheduling Interviews
If the Fellow is unable to make the scheduled time, they can switch with another Fellow who’s already scheduled up to 48 hours in advance. If a Fellow needs to reschedule last minute for any reason, they need to contact their Program Manager as soon as possible. If a Fellow is a no-show for the interview or reschedules last minute for any reason, they will not be rescheduled for at least two weeks.

### Recording lateness/no-shows
Fellows will check in with the Program Manager (or whoever is responsible that day for checking in Fellows to their interviews) to record attendance. If a Fellow is “Late”, “No Show with Communication”, or “No Show Without Communication", this is considered a potential red flag toward job readiness. 

### Passing Interviews
To pass the Behavioral Interview, Fellows must:
(1) score proficient or above on the following rubric items:
* Pop Pitch (tell me about yourself)
* Research Company
* Answering Questions - Technical Projects
* Asking Questions 
* Language & Voice
* Confidence
* Professionalism

(2) score proficient or above on at least 4 of the 5 “answering questions with STAR format” questions that focus on leadership, teamwork, growth-mindset/self awareness and solving problems. Fellows can get a ‘developing’ score on 1 of the 5 questions and still pass. 

### Recording Interviews 
We highly encourage Fellows to record their whiteboarding interview via Quicktime on their laptops so that they can watch their interview and share it with instructors for further feedback. Please keep videos and mock interview questions private for equitability across all Fellows. 

### Sharing Feedback to Fellows
Fellows will receive their results within 3 working days of the interview.
For all Fellows: Fellow will receive a summary of qualitative feedback from their Program Manager in writing via email (not slack). 
For those who "pass": A Fellow may also follow up with the PM in person.
For those "not proficient on key areas": PM and Fellow will schedule a 20 minute debrief where the PM shares a summary of feedback from the interviewer and discuss: 
* How did you think it went? 
* Where did you struggle? Where did you do well? 
* How will you keep practicing?

### Re-assessing Behavioral Interviews
After Fellows receive qualitative feedback following the interview and debrief, they will need to scheduled at least 1 additional practice round with their PM or another volunteer, and practice independently for a minimum of 1 week.
Volunteer and tech recruiter Melanie Lahti will be available to support Fellows through her virtual office hours EVERY Thursday. Fellows can sign up [here](https://calendly.com/melanielahti/pursuit?back=1&month=2020-03) to work with her. They should identify 2 BIQs they need help with and send them to Melanie in the calendly link prior to the meeting. 

### Timeliness and Professionalism of Fellows 
Timeliness and professionalism (clothing choice, writing utensils/paper, resume) have been flagged as important by employer partners. The certifying interviews are an opportunity for Fellows to practice professionalism during an end to end experience. 
Program Managers will be checking in all Fellows for their interview). During the check in, PMs will note the following in the Check in document for all Fellows:

* Timeliness 
* Appropriate dress (neat and tidy, no suit)
* Materials: copy of resume and writing utensil/paper

## Resumes, LinkedIn, Cover Letters
All resumes, LinkedIn profiles and cover letters will be assessed by Program Managers based on the relevant [rubrics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/119-wkCGEiGjR8iqf74Fys2BVRopvATN2nTKiOgbx6F4) with all scores updated in Canvas ongoing.

## Professionalism Red Flags
In addition to meeting the requirements for technical and professional certifications, Fellows must also show consistent professional behavior. Professionalism red flags include, but are not limited to: 

* consistent tardiness/absences, 
* unprofessional communication, 
* major struggles with teamwork. 

Fellows who fail to show consistent professionalism will be placed on an Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) of approximately 2-4 weeks to demonstrate improved professionalism, including completing any necessary actions (resubmission of projects, direct conversation with parties involved in conflict, etc.). Failure to demonstrate improvements will result in a separation.

## Certification!  
When a Fellow is fully job certified, they'll receive an email from the Program team outlining next steps to transition to the employment team.
