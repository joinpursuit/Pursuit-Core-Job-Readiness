## Certifying Technical Interviews

### Overview
##### Fellows will be invited to a certifying technical interview after demonstrating proficiency in 100% of the Whiteboarding DSA Standards and 85% in all DSA standards. Certifying technical interviews are conducted by a Certification Volunteer - member of a set group of volunteers with technical experience who have been trained to assess whiteboarding best practice.. Fellows must receive proficient or above in every rubric row with no more than one developing score in order to pass the technical interview. 

### Scheduling interviews
##### Program Managers will reach out to Fellows to schedule interviews after the Fellow demonstrates 85% proficiency in all DSA with 100% proficiency in DSA whiteboarding standards. Interviews are available M-Th from 6 PM - 8PM.


### Rescheduling Interviews
##### If the Fellow is unable to make the scheduled time, they can switch with another Fellow who’s already scheduled up to 48 hours in advance. If a Fellow is a no-show for the interview or reschedules last minute for any reason, they will not be rescheduled for at least two weeks.

### Recording Interviews 
##### We highly encourage Fellows to record their whiteboarding interview via Quicktime on their laptops so that they can watch their interview and share it with instructors for further feedback. 


### Lateness/no-shows
##### <B>It’s imperative Fellows arrive on time for certifying interviews</B>. Fellows will check in with the Program Manager (or whoever is responsible that day for checking in Fellows to their interviews) to record attendance.

You should come to that meeting prepared to discuss the following questions: 

###### * How did you think it went? 
##### * Where did you struggle? Where did you do well? 
##### * How will you keep practicing?


Fellows that pass may follow up at their discretion with their Lead Instructor for more feedback.



### Re-assessing Technical Interviews if You Don't Pass
##### Fellows who do not pass the certifying technical interview should practice the areas indicated in the feedback they receivedby signing up for Office Hours with the instructional team. To set up a second mock interview, please reach out to your PM. There must be a minimum of one whiteboarding office hours session with the Lead Instructor or an IA and at least one week of independent practice completed before scheduling a second certifying interview.


## Certifying Behavioral Interviews

Contact the PM via email to confirm the date, time, location and relevant job description for interview. Fellows will be scheduled if they’ve practiced Behavioral Interviews with the PM and have scored “proficient” across the rubric.  

### Rescheduling Interviews

If a Fellow needs to reschedule last minute for any reason, they need to contact their Program Manager as soon as possible.
