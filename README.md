## Certifying Technical Interviews

### Overview
##### Fellows will be proficient in DSA whiteboarding interviews  by passing a Certifying Technical Interview with a Certification Volunteer (receive proficient or above in every rubric row with no more than one developing score). Certification Volunteers are a set group of volunteers with technical experience who have been trained to certify Fellows for technical interviewing. Fellows that are at the 85% readiness mark for both non-DSA and DSA, and 100% for whiteboarding are generally considered “ready” for the technical interview certification. 

### Scheduling interviews
##### Fellows will work with Program Managers to schedule interviews. Fellows will be scheduled if they’ve practiced whiteboarding with their Instructional team and have scored “proficient” across the rubric.  Interviews are available M-Th from 6 PM - 8PM.

### Recording Interviews 
##### We highly encourage Fellows to record their whiteboarding interview via Quicktime on their laptops so that they can watch their interview and share it with instructors for further feedback. 

### Rescheduling Interviews
##### If the Fellow is unable to make the scheduled time, they can switch with another Fellow who’s already scheduled up to 48 hours in advance. If a Fellow is a no-show for the interview or reschedules last minute for any reason, they will not be rescheduled for at least two weeks.

### Recording lateness/no-shows
##### <B>It’s imperative Fellows arrive on time for certifying interviews</B>. Fellows will check in with the Program Manager (or whoever is responsible that day for checking in Fellows to their interviews) to record attendance. If a Fellow is “Late”, “No Show with Communication”, or “No Show Without Communication", this is considered a potential red flag toward job readiness. 

### Passing Interviews
##### To pass the Technical Interview, Fellows must:

##### (1) score proficient or above on 14 of the 15 subcategories in the Technical Interview Rubric, and

##### (2) not score "Not Demonstrated on any of the 15 subcategories. 

### Sharing Feedback to Fellows
##### For all Fellows: Fellow will receive a summary of qualitative feedback from their Lead Instructor in writing via email. 

##### For those who "pass": A Fellow may also follow up with their Lead Instructor in person.

##### For "needs practice in key areas": Lead instructor and Fellow will schedule a 20 minute debrief where the Lead Instructor shares a summary of feedback from the interviewer and discuss: 
##### * How did you think it went? 
##### * Where did you struggle? Where did you do well? 
##### * How will you keep practicing?

### Re-assessing Technical Interviews if You Don't Pass
##### After Fellows receive qualitative feedback from the interviewers, they should continue to practice whiteboarding by signing up for Office Hours with the instructional team, before letting their PM know they’d like to schedule another mock technical interview. In order for Fellows to set up a second mock interview, there must be a minimum of one whiteboarding office hours session with the Lead Instructor or an IA and at least one week of independent practice completed.


## Certifying Behavioral Interviews 

### Interview format
##### Fellows will have 45 minutes for their mock interview with a volunteer. Prepare for this as a real interview, including how you dress, and how you research the company and role. Fellows will be assessed along the updated [link] Behavioral Interview rubric.
 
### Scheduling interviews
##### Program Managers will sign up Fellows who are ready for mock behavioral interviews every two weeks. Contact the PM via email to confirm the date, time, location and relevant job description for interview. Fellows will be scheduled if they’ve practiced Behavioral Interviews with the PM already and have scored “proficient” across the rubric.  

### Rescheduling Interviews
##### If the Fellow is unable to make the scheduled time, they can switch with another Fellow who’s already scheduled up to 48 hours in advance. If a Fellow needs to reschedule last minute for any reason, they need to contact their Program Manager as soon as possible. If a Fellow is a no-show for the interview or reschedules last minute for any reason, they will not be rescheduled for at least two weeks.

##### Fellows who fail to show consistent professionalism will be placed on an Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) of approximately 2-4 weeks to demonstrate improved professionalism, including completing any necessary actions (resubmission of projects, direct conversation with parties involved in conflict, etc.). Failure to demonstrate improvements will result in a separation.
